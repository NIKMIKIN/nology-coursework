### Requirement of Tests
(1)Tests purpose are to ensure that our functions are able to inventory our animals and enclose them within tables. (2)We must validate the functionality of our new features. Types
 of tests that will be implemented will be testing our connection to queries, whether or not animals are being enclosed within their enclosure, how many animals are being logged, and
that id's are being logged to animals and the table. (3) For inputs well have to use data such as different animals, positive and negative values for quantities, and test our database
 and connection. (4) Expected outputs should be all animals, types, and quantities. (5) assumptions being made are that we don't place same animal types in enclosures. (6) Constraints
 could be compatibility issues between animals and enclosures. (7) risks and potential issues are most likely to come from query tables and apis.

 ###USER Stories
 As a test engineer, I want to be able to ensure quality tests at the end of development
